BLOG site
Individuals or their groups can have their blogs. Blog messages are represented by showing the newest material at the top, old messages are in archives (special catalogues). Blog messages (or diary blocks) can contain text and pictures. Readers can leave comments and get answers. All users are registered, thus, the system should be able to show a list of blogs, the content of a particular blog, expand the comments, enable conversations, and search on different criteria, e.g. user name, date, some keyword (phrase).
