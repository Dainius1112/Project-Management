Rent of Conference Equipment
The company rents various equipment for conferences and other events. Auditoriums and classrooms are of different sizes and need different equipment. But rooms and equipment can be rented separately. The system should choose the rooms and auditoriums automatically based on various requirements (number of participants, type of event, planned activities, etc.) and the system should choose only this equipment and those rooms that are not reserved for a particular day (period). If no rooms are available the system should suggest other days.
