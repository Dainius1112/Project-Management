Group Timetable/Calendar
The system should store timetables of several persons. Common meetings, lectures, events should be presented, also, the system should store personal timetables/calendars. Thus, the person should see his own calendar and common (actual) events. E.g. OOP is valid for the teacher and all first year students of IT, but some students also attend MIFSA meetings.
