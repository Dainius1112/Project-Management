Version Control System
Common reports and programs or information blocks are modified by several users as the latest version of any material should be accessible for all project (group) members. The system should be able to show the last version and all the previous versions, and to recover to some previous version if the last version is broken. The system should show what was changed in each version, who made the modification, who worked and committed most frequently.
